#TASK: generate 100 random numbers from exponential distribution where mean number of events per time period is 2
rexp(n = 100, rate = 0.2)
#TASK: generate 100 random numbers from Weibull distribution with shape of 1.5 (probability of event increases over time) and characteristic life of 5000 (time to failure)
rweibull(n = 100, shape = 1.5, scale = 5000)
